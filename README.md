# Introduction

The [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) instant messaging application includes the ability for users to export their chats via the application, which allows users to preserve their chats in a text-based format. This export, like any text-based media, can be parsed and manipulated programmatically.

Unfortunately, progammatic manipulation of the chat exports provided by the WhatsApp application has been proven to be tricky due to the fact that the exports exhibit severe formatting inconsistencies. Inconsistencies are introduced based on a number of factors, including operating system, system locale and time zone. This documentation sets out to comprehensively document all known inconsistencies, in as much detail as possible.

The research behind this documentation has been carried out for the benefit of the general public, and as such this work has been licensed to the public domain under the [Unlicense](https://github.com/linuswillner/whatsapp-export-inconsistencies/blob/master/LICENSE).

I hope that this research proves useful to you. If you found use in this, consider [buying me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/linuswillner) to say thanks for pouring through all the nooks and crannies in thousands of lines of chat exports.
